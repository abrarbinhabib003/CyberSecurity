# 🧪 Hands-on Lab: Installing, Updating, and Working with Text Editors
---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you'll be able to:

✅ Use `sudo` to access admin (super-user) tools  
✅ Use `apt` to update and install packages  
✅ Upgrade the `nano` text editor  
✅ Install the `vim` text editor  
✅ Understand system package management basics

---

## 🔥 **Exercise 1: Upgrading and Installing Packages**

---

### 💡 What's the Goal?

To **update your system**, **upgrade Nano**, and **install Vim** using the terminal like a true Linux pro.  
This is your first step in mastering **Linux system administration**. 💻🚀

---

### 🔐 1.1 Understanding `sudo`

#### 👉 What is `sudo`?

- `sudo` stands for **superuser do**
- Grants **temporary administrator privileges**
- Required to run **system-level** commands like installing or upgrading software

#### 🧠 Real-Life Analogy:
Like entering your password to approve app downloads or settings changes on your phone 📱

#### ✅ Command:
```bash
sudo apt update
```

> This updates the list of available packages and their versions — but does **not install** or upgrade anything yet.

---

### 🗂️ 1.2 How `apt` Works

#### 📦 What is `apt`?

- **Advanced Packaging Tool** for managing software on Linux
- Can **install**, **upgrade**, **remove**, and **update** software

---

### 🔄 Step 1: Updating the Package List Index

```bash
sudo apt update
```

🔍 This syncs your system with the online repositories listed in `/etc/apt/sources.list`.

#### 📁 Bonus Tip:
Open this file to see where your system fetches packages from:
```bash
nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

---

### ✍️ Step 2: Upgrading `nano`

📝 `nano` is a beginner-friendly, terminal-based text editor.

#### ✅ Upgrade Command:
```bash
sudo apt upgrade nano
```

#### 📌 Notes:
- You might see: `Do you want to continue? [Y/n]`
  - Press `Y` and hit `Enter` 👍
- If you see a colon prompt (`:`), just press `q` to **exit** the prompt and continue

---

### 🔧 Step 3: Installing `vim`

💪 `vim` is a **powerful**, **configurable**, and **fast** text editor—but has a learning curve.

#### ✅ Install Command:
```bash
sudo apt install vim
```

- Again, if prompted: `Do you want to continue? [Y/n]`
  - Hit `Y` and press `Enter`

> Now you're ready to edit like a pro 💻🔥

## 🧠 Smart Tips & Tricks

📌 Always run `sudo apt update` before installing or upgrading software  
⚠️ Never shut down your system while it's updating or installing packages  
📄 Want to explore `apt`? Try: `man apt` for manual info

## 🧩 Practice Challenge

Try running all three commands below. Then open files using Nano and Vim!

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade nano
sudo apt install vim
```

After that:

# 🧪 **Hands-on Lab: Creating and Editing Files with Nano**  
**Topic:** *Exercise 2 – Working with nano*  

📌 *Prerequisites: nano installed via `sudo apt upgrade nano`*

---

## 🎯 **Learning Goals**

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

✅ Navigate to a specific project directory using the `cd` command  
✅ Use `nano` to create and edit a text file  
✅ Save your file and verify its contents using `cat`  

---

## 🗂️ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 🔹 **2.1 Navigating to the Project Directory**

🧭 **Command:**
```bash
cd /home/project
```

💡 **Tip:** Try using **auto-completion** with the Tab key:
```bash
cd /home/pr [Press TAB]
```

🔍 **Why this matters:**  
This command moves you to the correct working directory where you'll store your file. `cd` stands for *change directory*, and `/home/project` is a sandbox folder where you won’t mess up system files.

📂 **Check the directory is empty:**
```bash
ls
```
You shouldn't see anything yet—this confirms you're starting fresh.

---

### 📝 **2.2 Creating and Editing a File with `nano`**

📌 **Command to create + open file:**
```bash
nano hello_world.txt
```

🎉 This:
- **Creates** a new file named `hello_world.txt` (if it doesn’t exist)
- **Opens** it in the **nano** text editor

🖊️ **Now type this inside nano:**
```
Hello world!
This is the second line of my first-ever text file created with nano.
```

⚠️ **Important Concepts in nano:**
- You're now editing a **text buffer** (temporary space where your changes live before saving)
- You can **navigate** using arrow keys
- Press **Enter** to go to a new line

---

### 💾 **Saving and Exiting Nano**

📌 When done typing, press:

```bash
CTRL + X
```
This triggers **exit**, but before quitting, nano checks if you want to save your changes.

🧩 **Prompt appears:**
```
Save modified buffer (ANSWERING "No" WILL DESTROY CHANGES)?  
 Y Yes  
 N No           ^C Cancel  
```

✅ Press `Y` to save  
✅ Then press `Enter` to confirm the filename (`hello_world.txt`)

🧘 You’re back at the terminal!

---

### 📂 **2.3 Verifying Your File**

Let’s confirm everything worked:

📌 **Use `cat` to display the file:**
```bash
cat hello_world.txt
```

👀 You should see:
```
Hello world!
This is the second line of my first-ever text file created with nano.
```

🔥 Congratulations! You've:
- Created your first file using nano
- Edited content inside the terminal
- Saved and verified the file using Linux commands

---

---

## 📘 **3.1 Quick Intro to Vim**

### 🔧 Start Vim by simply typing:
```bash
vim
```

This opens up the **Vim environment**, which looks different from nano. You'll see a screen like:

```
~  ~  ~
VIM - Vi IMproved
type :help<Enter> for help
```

---

### 💡 Modes in Vim:

| Mode | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 📝 Insert Mode | For typing/editing text |
| 💼 Command Mode | For saving, quitting, and running commands |

📌 You're in **Command Mode** by default when you open Vim.

---

### 🆘 Get Help in Vim

Inside Vim, type:
```vim
:help
```

This opens a help file.

📜 **Navigation Tips:**
- Use **arrow keys** or **Page Up/Page Down** to scroll
- To exit the help screen, type:
```vim
:q
```

You’ll be back at the Vim home screen or terminal.

---

## 🛠️ **3.2 Creating and Editing a File in Vim**

### 📂 First, go to your project directory:
```bash
cd /home/project
```

---

### 📝 Create + Open a file in Vim:
```bash
vim hello_world_2.txt
```

This opens a new (or existing) file called `hello_world_2.txt`.

---

### ✍️ Start typing in Vim:

1. Press `i`  
   → Now you're in **Insert Mode** (You'll see `-- INSERT --` at the bottom)

2. Type this:
```
Hello World!
This is the second line.
```

3. Press `Esc`  
   → This returns you to **Command Mode**

---

### 💾 Save and Exit Vim

Now that you're in **Command Mode**, type:
```vim
:w
```
✅ This **writes** (saves) the file

Then type:
```vim
:q
```
✅ This **quits** Vim

🧠 You can also do both in one go:
```vim
:wq
```
(*Write and Quit together*)

---

## 🧠 Real-World Relevance

📌 **Why Vim?**
- Powerful editor used in servers, development, and sysadmin tasks
- Keyboard-based, ideal for remote editing via SSH
- Highly customizable and super fast for experts

🛡️ **Use in Cybersecurity / DevOps / Programming:**

I am done with the lab!
```
…when you run it using `bash`.

---

### 🛠 Steps:

1. Open Vim and create the file:
```bash
vim done.txt
```

2. Press `i` to enter **Insert mode**

3. Type the following:
```bash
