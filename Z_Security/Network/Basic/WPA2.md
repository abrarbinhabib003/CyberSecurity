In this lecture, we begin discussing how to crack WPA and WPA2 encryption, which are significantly more secure than WEP, but still vulnerable under certain conditions. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts covered in this lesson:

### Key Concepts:

1. **WPA vs WPA2:**
   - Both WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) and WPA2 are designed to address the weaknesses in WEP encryption.
   - The primary difference between WPA and WPA2 is the encryption method used for message integrity:
     - **WPA** uses **TKIP** (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol).
     - **WPA2** uses **CCMP** (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol).
   - Both encryption methods are more secure than WEP, and the methods we will discuss to crack them work for both WPA and WPA2.

2. **WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup):**
   - WPS is a feature designed to simplify the process of connecting devices (like printers) to a Wi-Fi network without requiring the user to enter the network password.
   - It works by using an **eight-digit PIN** for authentication instead of the network key. 
   - **WPS Button:** You press a button on the router and on the device (like a printer), and they automatically authenticate without needing the Wi-Fi password.

3. **Exploiting WPS for Cracking WPA/WPA2:**
   - **WPS PIN Method:** If **WPS is enabled and misconfigured** on the target network, it can be exploited to crack the WPA or WPA2 key.
   - **WPS PINs** are 8-digit numeric passwords, which result in a relatively small number of possibilities (10 million combinations) that can be tested in a short time.
   - If the WPS feature is misconfigured to allow the use of **normal PIN authentication** (not push-button authentication), we can try all possible PIN combinations until we find the correct one.
   - **Push Button Authentication (PBC):** If PBC is enabled, the router will refuse any PIN attempts unless the physical button is pressed, so the method won't work in that case.

4. **Why This Works:**
   - If we successfully guess the correct **WPS PIN**, we can then use it to recover the actual WPA or WPA2 key, without directly cracking the encryption itself.
   - This method doesn’t exploit WPA/WPA2 encryption directly, but rather a vulnerability in the WPS feature.

5. **Limitations:**
   - Most modern routers **disable WPS** by default, or use **PBC**, which means this method won't always work.
   - If WPS is misconfigured, however, this method can be a much faster alternative to brute-forcing WPA/WPA2.

### Step-by-Step Process for Exploiting WPS:

1. **Check if WPS is enabled** on the target network. This can be done using tools like **Reaver** or **wash**.
2. **Verify if the WPS feature is misconfigured** to allow PIN authentication.
3. **Brute-force the WPS PIN** by trying all possible combinations of the 8-digit PIN (which is feasible with modern computational power).
4. **Once the PIN is cracked, use it** to retrieve the actual WPA/WPA2 key and gain access to the network.

### Next Steps:

- If WPS is enabled and misconfigured, this method can be very fast, potentially taking only a few hours to crack.
- If the WPS method fails (due to PBC or other protections), you can move on to more advanced methods of cracking WPA/WPA2 that will be covered in the next lessons.

### Key Takeaways:
- **WPA/WPA2** are more secure than WEP, but they can still be cracked, especially if WPS is enabled and misconfigured.
- **WPS PIN brute-force** is a fast method if WPS is vulnerable, but it requires that WPS is enabled and improperly configured (normal PIN authentication).
- **PBC-enabled routers** will block PIN attempts, so this method won't work on routers using PBC for WPS.

**Instructor: Practical WPS PIN Cracking Method**  

- **Instructor's Setup:**
  - The instructor is using a Kali machine with the wireless adapter set to monitor mode.
  - The goal is to identify networks with WPS enabled using the **"wash"** tool.
  
- **Step 1: Identify Networks with WPS Enabled:**
  - The command to use is:  
    ```bash
    wash --interface mon0
    ```
  - **"mon0"** refers to the wireless adapter in monitor mode.  
  - The output shows the details of nearby networks, including the **WPS status** (locked or not), the **vendor** of the hardware, and **version** used (v1 or v2).
  
- **Step 2: Fake Authentication Attack:**
  - Before running the attack, a **fake authentication attack** is needed to associate with the target network and ensure it accepts PIN attempts.
  - The command to use:
    ```bash
    aireplay-ng --fakeauth <delay> -a <target_bssid> -h <adapter_mac> mon0
    ```
    - **<delay>**: Time to wait between association attempts.
    - **<target_bssid>**: MAC address of the target network.
    - **<adapter_mac>**: MAC address of the wireless adapter.

- **Step 3: Use Reaver to Brute Force the WPS PIN:**
  - The **Reaver** tool is used to brute-force the PIN.
  - The command to use:
    ```bash
    reaver --bssid <target_bssid> --channel <channel> --interface mon0 -vvv --no-associate
    ```
  - Reaver will try each possible 8-digit PIN until it finds the correct one.
  - If successful, it will generate the WPA/WPA2 key from the WPS PIN.

- **Step 4: Confirm Cracked WPA/WPA2 Key:**
  - Once the correct PIN is found, Reaver computes the WPA key, allowing access to the network.
  - Example: The cracked PIN **12345670** gives the WPA key **U-A-U-R-W-S-X-R**.

---

The key takeaway here is that WPS vulnerabilities, especially on misconfigured routers with weak PINs, can be exploited to crack WPA/WPA2 keys quickly without directly attacking the encryption itself. However, the method only works if **WPS** is enabled and misconfigured, making it a viable attack method under certain circumstances.

### Cracking WPA/WPA2 Encryption After WPS is Disabled or Uses PBC

#### **Introduction:**
- If **WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)** is **disabled** on your target network, or if it uses **Push Button Authentication (PBC)**, the previous method for cracking WPA or WPA2 encryption won't work.
- In these cases, the next option is to crack the **WPA or WPA2 encryption** itself. Unlike **WEP**, WPA and WPA2 encryptions were designed with much stronger security in mind.

#### **WPA/WPA2 Design:**
- **WPA2** encryption keys are **unique, temporary, and long**. Therefore, even capturing a million packets would be useless for cracking the key.
- The only packets that contain useful information for us are the **handshake packets**. These are transferred between a client and the router when the client connects to the network.

#### **Capturing the Handshake:**
To capture these handshake packets, we’ll use the following approach:

1. **Running Airodump-ng:**
   - You need to use **airodump-ng** to capture network data. This tool will help you identify the **BSSID** (the MAC address of your target router), the channel the router is on, and the specific network you're targeting.
   - The captured data will be stored in a file for future analysis.

   **Command:**
   ```bash
   airodump-ng --bssid [Target_BSSID] --channel [Channel] --write WPA_handshake mon0
   ```

   - **`--bssid`** specifies the MAC address of the target network.
   - **`--channel`** tells airodump-ng the channel of the network.
   - **`--write`** stores all captured packets into a file (here named "WPA_handshake").

2. **Waiting for the Handshake:**
   - Normally, the handshake will be captured when a client connects to the network.
   - However, if you don’t want to wait, you can use a **deauthentication attack** to force the client to disconnect and reconnect, which will result in the transmission of the handshake.

3. **Performing the Deauthentication Attack:**
   - The deauthentication attack can be run with **aireplay-ng**, which will disconnect the client temporarily. When the client reconnects, the handshake is sent again and can be captured.
   - This can be done with a **very short attack** (e.g., sending only **4 deauthentication packets**), so the client won’t even notice the disconnection.

   **Command:**
   ```bash
   aireplay-ng --deauth 4 -a [Target_BSSID] -c [Client_MAC] mon0
   ```

   - **`--deauth 4`** sends 4 deauthentication packets.
   - **`-a [Target_BSSID]`** specifies the router's MAC address.
   - **`-c [Client_MAC]`** specifies the MAC address of the client you want to disconnect.
   - **`mon0`** is your wireless adapter in monitor mode.

4. **Capturing the Handshake:**
   - After the client reconnects, the handshake will be captured automatically.
   - Once you see the handshake in airodump-ng, you can **stop the capture** (Ctrl+C) as the handshake is now stored in the file (`WPA_handshake`).

#### **Conclusion:**
- After capturing the handshake, in the next lecture, you'll learn how to use the handshake to **crack the WPA2 key** and gain access to the network.

Here’s a breakdown of the lecture content:

In this lecture, we focus on WPA and WPA2 encryption, specifically the process of recovering the password through a wordlist attack. We previously learned how to capture the handshake, but the handshake itself doesn't directly reveal the WPA password. Instead, it contains information that allows us to check if a password is valid. To do that, we need to create a wordlist — a large text file containing potential passwords.

The method involves:

1. **Creating a Wordlist**: 
   - You can use existing wordlists available on the internet, but this lecture teaches you how to create your own using a tool called **Crunch**. Crunch allows you to generate passwords with specified characteristics, such as a minimum and maximum length, specific characters, and patterns.
   
2. **Using Crunch to Generate Passwords**:
   - To generate a wordlist using Crunch, you specify:
     - The minimum and maximum length of the password.
     - The characters from which you want the password to be generated.
     - Optional patterns (e.g., the password must start with a specific character).
     - The output file to store the generated passwords.

   **Example Command**:
   ```bash
   crunch 6 8 abc123 -o wordlist.txt
   ```
   - This command generates passwords between 6 and 8 characters long, using the characters `a`, `b`, `c`, `1`, `2`, and `3`, and saves them in `wordlist.txt`.

3. **Options in Crunch**:
   - **-p**: Prevents repeating characters in generated passwords (helpful to reduce the size of the wordlist).
   - **-t**: Defines patterns for password generation. For example, if you know the password starts with an "A" and ends with a "B," you can tell Crunch to generate only those passwords.
   
4. **Understanding the Results**:
   - Once you generate the wordlist, you can view it using `cat wordlist.txt` to check the passwords it contains.
   - This wordlist can now be used with the previously captured handshake to check if any of the passwords are valid.

By using this method, you can create custom wordlists tailored to the specific patterns or characteristics of passwords you're targeting. This is especially useful for penetration testing scenarios where password patterns might be known or can be guessed.

Here’s a practical breakdown of the process for cracking a WPA/WPA2 password using a wordlist attack with Aircrack-ng. The following steps demonstrate how the process works in practice:

### Tools & Setup:
- **Aircrack-ng**: A tool used to perform the actual cracking of WPA/WPA2 passwords by processing the captured handshake and matching it with the passwords in a wordlist.
- **Wordlist (test.txt)**: A file containing potential passwords that will be tested against the handshake.
- **Handshake File**: A captured handshake file (e.g., `WPA handshake 01.cap`) obtained during the network connection.

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Capture the Handshake**:
   - First, you need to capture the WPA or WPA2 handshake, which contains the necessary information to crack the password.
   - This is done by listening to the network traffic when a client connects to the router, capturing the authentication packets (handshakes).
   
2. **Prepare the Wordlist**:
   - You create or download a wordlist file (e.g., `test.txt`) that contains many possible passwords. The more comprehensive the wordlist, the higher the chance of success.
   - For practical purposes, the wordlist might include a target password you know, such as your password, appended at the end for testing.

3. **Run Aircrack-ng**:
   - Once you have both the handshake file and wordlist, you run Aircrack-ng to attempt cracking the WPA/WPA2 password.
   
   The basic command to run Aircrack-ng is:
   ```bash
   aircrack-ng WPA_handshake_01.cap -w test.txt
   ```

   Here's what each part of the command does:
   - `aircrack-ng`: The tool to crack the password.
   - `WPA_handshake_01.cap`: The captured handshake file.
   - `-w test.txt`: Specifies the wordlist file to be used for password guessing.

4. **Process**:
   - Aircrack-ng will go through each password in the wordlist, trying it one by one.
   - For each password, it will:
     - Use the information from the handshake (like the ESSID and the message integrity code, or MIC).
     - Generate a MIC based on the password.
     - Compare this MIC with the one in the handshake. If they match, the password is found.
     - If the MIC doesn’t match, Aircrack-ng will move on to the next password in the list.

5. **Completion**:
   - Aircrack-ng will either find the correct password or exhaust the wordlist. If the correct password is found, it will display it on the screen as:
     ```
     Key Found: [password]
     ```
   - If no match is found, you can try a different wordlist or extend the current wordlist.

### Practical Example:
- Let's say your wordlist (`test.txt`) contains various passwords like:
  ```
  password123
  mywifi
  admin123
  password2025
  12345678
  ```
- You run the command:
  ```bash
  aircrack-ng WPA_handshake_01.cap -w test.txt
  ```
- Aircrack-ng will try each password in the list and compare it to the handshake. If, for example, `mywifi` is the correct password, the program will output:
  ```
  Key Found: mywifi
  ```

### Speed Considerations:
- **CPU vs GPU**: Cracking passwords with Aircrack-ng using a CPU can be slow, especially with a large wordlist. If you have a compatible GPU, you can use it to significantly speed up the cracking process since GPUs can perform many calculations simultaneously.
- **Rainbow Tables**: These are precomputed password hash databases, which can speed up the process but require more storage and are less flexible compared to a wordlist attack.
- **Piping Wordlist Creation**: If you need to generate a large wordlist on the fly, you can pipe the output of the Crunch tool directly to Aircrack-ng without saving the file on disk, which saves storage space.

### Conclusion:
- Cracking WPA/WPA2 passwords using Aircrack-ng is highly dependent on the quality of your wordlist. The more comprehensive the wordlist, the higher the chances of success.
- Other techniques, like using rainbow tables, leveraging a GPU, or using social engineering (such as an evil twin attack), can further enhance the attack process.
  
By practicing this method, you can become proficient in WPA/WPA2 cracking, a valuable skill for penetration testing. However, it's important to use this knowledge ethically and responsibly.
